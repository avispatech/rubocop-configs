# rubocop-configs

Getting started in a project requires a lot of "paperwork".

One of them is setting the correct `.rubocop.yml` file in the project so they are all consistent.

We will start taking the Rubocop File from Rails as of January 5th, 2023, and we will modify them as we evolve.

The main file will be the `root` file, and if a change is done, it should be propagated to the folders that will be named by the ruby versions.


## Collaboration

To collaborate, create a branch with the name of the Cop. i.e: style-string-literals

On the pull request get the information from Rubocop Webpage, show the examples and argue why you are taking the decision to add, modify or remove the cop.

Be sure to propagate the change everywhere it works!
