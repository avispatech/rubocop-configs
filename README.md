# rubocop-configs

Getting started in a project requires a lot of "paperwork".

One of them is setting the correct rubocop.yml file in the project so they are all consistent.

We will start taking the Rubocop File from Rails as of January 5th, 2023, and we will modify them as we evolve.

The main file will be the `root` file, and if a change is done, it should be propagated to the folders that will be named by the ruby versions.
